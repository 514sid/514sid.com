title: How devices delete files so fast

I clicked "delete" on a 1 GB file. One second later, it was gone. Or at least, that is what it appeared to be.

We do this every day: select a file, hit delete, empty the trash, and move on. But how can a device erase something so large almost instantly?

Most modern operating systems do not actually remove the data when a file is deleted. Instead, they update metadata, the internal map that tracks where files are stored. The file's entry in the directory is removed, and the blocks on storage are marked as free. The data itself remains until it is overwritten by new information.

Updating a few pointers in the file system is almost instantaneous. Even a 1 GB file, spread across hundreds of fragments, can be "deleted" in milliseconds. The OS does not process the file's content; it only adjusts the metadata.

While deletion is fast, it does not always guarantee that the data is permanently removed.

On some devices, particularly traditional storage or SSDs without TRIM, deleted data may remain and can sometimes be recovered using specialized software.

On modern SSDs with TRIM enabled, deleted data is typically erased internally by the drive, making recovery much more difficult.

How permanent a deletion is depends on the underlying storage technology.

Deleting a file illustrates an important concept in modern computing. Operations that appear costly, such as moving large amounts of data, can often be avoided through efficient metadata management and system design.

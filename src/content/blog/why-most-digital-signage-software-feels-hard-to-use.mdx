title: Why most digital signage software feels hard to use

If you've ever tried digital signage software, you quickly notice something. Most of it feels complicated. The interface looks old, the settings are overwhelming, and using it takes more effort than you'd expect in 2025.

And it's not just that it feels hard to use. It actually is hard to use. Many platforms require vendor support for almost anything beyond the basics.

It might look like these companies don't care about design or ease of use. But the real story is different. Stability is always the first priority.

It doesn't matter if you run a small caf√© with two screens or a global retailer with thousands. What you really need is the same. Your content must show up on time, every time. No glitches. No blank screens. No missed schedules.

A nice interface won't save you if the system crashes when it matters most. Think of a restaurant that plans digital menu changes for the lunch rush, only to find screens frozen at noon. Or an airport where signage is supposed to guide passengers to gates, but the displays suddenly go black. When that happens, it doesn't matter how clean the dashboard design looked during setup.

This is where natural selection comes in. Just like in evolution, where only the most adapted species survive, the same happens in software. Products that prove they can run without failure survive. Products that focus on beauty but collapse under pressure disappear. Over time, the market itself filters out the weak ones.

If someone asked me how to choose digital signage software, my answer would be simple. Don't rely on marketing websites or salesman speeches. Take a two-week trial and use it exactly as you would in real life. If it runs smoothly, then it's a good choice. I haven't seen a single product that performs equally well across all platforms. Some are better on Tizen, some on webOS, and that difference only shows up when you test it yourself.

That's why so many tools in this space feel clunky and require constant vendor involvement. It's not because the companies think their interfaces are perfect. It's because a redesign or more intuitive workflows don't add stability, and stability is what customers are really paying for.

I don't think this situation is cool. It's just reality. Personally, I dream about a product that is both stable and nice to use. That combination would change the market completely, forcing every other product to either evolve or disappear.

title: I joined Screenly as a product manager

A few weeks ago, I posted on Reddit that I was open to new opportunities. I didn't think too much about it. I expected a couple of messages and some interesting conversations.

What happened next surprised me.

In less than two weeks, more than ten companies reached out. Most of the messages came directly from CEOs, founders, and top managers.

Our conversations weren't interviews. They were genuine discussions about products, users, and long-term vision.

As those talks continued, Screenly started to stand out. It wasn't one big moment, but rather a realization that we were already heading in the same direction. Joining the team felt less like starting a new job and more like joining forces.

This was clear from my first talk with [Viktor Petersson](https://vpetersson.com/), the CEO of Screenly. We were so aligned that he was describing the same ideas I had already written about on my own blog. That kind of shared vision is rare, and it's what convinced me that this was the right fit.

I'm happy to share that I've officially joined Screenly as a product manager last week.

## Approach to building products

What impressed me most was Screenly's disciplined approach to building software.

Instead of trying to do everything at once, they focus on making a few things exceptionally secure and reliable. They are intentional about who they build for, which allows them to solve real problems for specific users rather than creating a bloated product that tries to please everyone. This commitment to long-term thinking and careful prioritization is exactly how I believe great products are made.

I appreciate the team’s open approach to feedback. They don’t claim to be perfect, and they see constructive criticism as a chance to grow rather than a personal judgment. Perfection is treated as a moving target, and every piece of feedback helps refine the product until it truly meets the mark.

One guiding principle is that no half-baked features should be released. Everything that reaches users must be reliable and polished.

Like me, the team prioritizes keeping the user experience simple and intuitive. By focusing on improving existing features instead of just chasing new ones, we make sure the product remains dependable and easy to use as it grows.

## The team

Another important factor for me is the team. In digital signage, [reliability is everything](/blog/reliability-digital-signage-software/). Screens need to run continuously, systems need to stay stable, and products need to perform in real-world conditions. The team at Screenly consists of experienced engineers and security experts with more than 10 years in the industry.

They have worked on real deployments, faced edge cases, and built systems that scale. For me, it's valuable to work with people who understand what it really takes to deliver secure, reliable, and well-engineered solutions.

This combination of technical expertise, security focus, and practical experience gives me confidence that the product can continue to evolve while staying dependable.

## Building open source solutions together

Screenly maintains Anthias, which is the most popular open source digital signage software on GitHub. At the same time, I have been building open source tools under the Screenlite branding — a CMS, player apps, and other solutions that can be used across the industry.

Viktor shares the vision that the market needs a modern, simple-to-use open source solution that is also centrally manageable. Together, we plan to continue developing both Anthias and Screenlite, but over time the Screenlite brand will be retired, and everything will live under the Anthias name.

It was very important to me to continue building open source solutions, and it was great to see that Viktor and the team were fully supportive of that.

## Supporting the community

Joining Screenly gives me the opportunity to continue contributing to the community, as well as to my content and open source projects, in a more structured and supported way.

The Screenly team, and especially Viktor, are committed to providing valuable information and helping educate the digital signage ecosystem, which aligns with the work I've been doing independently to share insights and support the community.

Having the Screenly name behind these efforts doesn't mean the content will be focused on Screenly. I will maintain a clear distinction between Screenly-related content and resources for the broader industry, respecting other solutions and keeping the information neutral and useful, which Viktor fully agreed with.

We will also be working together on [SignageList](https://signagelist.org/), the largest directory of digital signage software. The goal is to make it a go-to reference for the industry, helping anyone discover, compare, and evaluate digital signage solutions efficiently.

Importantly, joining Screenly will not affect my role as a Reddit community moderator. I will remain neutral when enforcing rules and continue to listen to and support the community independently. At the same time, Screenly will actively support the Reddit community, both through my involvement and by helping improve the space for everyone in the industry.

## Looking ahead

I am genuinely happy to join Screenly and work with a team that shares my vision for the future of digital signage. This move allows me to keep doing what I love, but with the resources and support of an experienced team behind me. Together, we will continue to support the community, improve tools like SignageList, and grow our open source projects.

I am excited to get started. My goal is to help grow this industry in a way that is collaborative, respectful, and focused on delivering real value to everyone involved.

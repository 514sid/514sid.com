title: Why simple tools win

When I started working on Screenlite, I kept coming back to one core question:

> What's the simplest possible version of this that still solves the problem?

It turns out, simplicity is hard.

It's much easier to add features than to remove them. It's easier to say yes than to say not yet. But every extra button, setting, or requirement pushes a tool further from being usable by someone new.

I think the best tools are the ones that don't make you feel dumb. They do one thing well. They get out of the way.

A lot of people confuse "simple" with "basic" or "incomplete". But I've found that simple is often just clear. Focused. Purposeful.

I remind myself of this every time I'm tempted to add something.

Simplicity takes discipline, but it's worth it.

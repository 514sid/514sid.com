title: Thoughts on Navori's acquisition of Signagelive

Navori Labs just announced it is acquiring Signagelive. The press release describes it as a strong combination of technology, talent, and global reach. But looking past the PR, this seems like a smart move to deal with the slow pace of organic growth in the digital signage industry.

Here's why.

Digital signage software is hard to replace. Once a system is installed across a network of screens, switching platforms means reinstalling software, reconfiguring hardware, and retraining staff. This makes churn very low. That might sound great, but it also limits the chances to win new customers. Most users stick with what they have for years.

Because of that, organic growth becomes difficult. To keep growing, companies often choose to acquire competitors rather than wait for new customers to come to them. That seems to be the case here. By acquiring Signagelive, Navori expands its customer base and strengthens its global presence without needing to convert reluctant switchers.

The companies say this will create one of the largest independent CMS providers in digital signage. While that claim is hard to verify, the strategy is clear. This is about building market share in a fragmented industry where growth through customer wins is slow.

In short, digital signage is a sticky market. Once customers are in, they stay. That makes acquisitions like this a logical way to grow.

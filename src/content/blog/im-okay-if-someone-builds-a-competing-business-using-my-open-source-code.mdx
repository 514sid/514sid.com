title: I’m okay if someone builds a competing business using my open source code

Since I decided to make Screenlite open source, one question keeps coming up:

> "Why not just keep the product closed, start earning money, and avoid the risk of someone using your code to build a competing business?"

I get it. Open sourcing can seem risky — like handing potential competitors a shortcut. But from the beginning, I accepted that possibility. And honestly, I’m completely okay with it.

## Open sourcing Screenlite was a deliberate choice

Most digital signage tools today are closed-source, outdated, complex, and expensive. I wanted to build something different: a modern, easy-to-use, fully open-source alternative that people could trust and extend.

That’s why I chose the MIT license instead of something more restrictive like AGPL.

MIT allows anyone to use, modify, and build commercial products on top of Screenlite. This encourages experimentation, collaboration, and adoption — without legal barriers.

Open source goes beyond simply sharing code. It’s about building trust, expanding reach, and creating a real community around the project.

## It’s more than just code

Having the source code doesn’t automatically give someone a business.

Running a successful service takes much more: customer support, marketing, operations, infrastructure, trust, security, and long-term commitment.

Anyone can host Screenlite, but turning it into a business people trust and rely on — that’s not easy. And that’s exactly why I’m not worried.

I plan to launch a managed Screenlite service in the future.

At the same time, I welcome others to build on top of Screenlite.

## Why one managed Screenlite service can’t serve everyone

There’s no one-size-fits-all for digital signage, and I don’t expect to serve every market.

First, local AV integrators play a key role.

These professionals have close relationships with their clients — often businesses that wouldn’t discover digital signage tools on their own. Selling directly to these businesses is expensive and inefficient, so I don’t expect enterprises or large companies to be my primary customers.

Instead, I welcome integrators who want to host Screenlite for their clients. They can earn additional revenue, provide localized support, and potentially contribute valuable feedback and improvements back to the project.

Second, operating a global managed service is difficult.

Running sales and support across time zones and languages requires major resources. That’s not my immediate focus.

I expect local versions of Screenlite to emerge in different regions — each adapted to meet the needs of specific markets.

## Open source benefits everyone

Some users will want to host Screenlite themselves — not to resell it, but simply to meet their own needs. These might be small teams, nonprofits, schools, or companies with internal signage requirements. Open source gives them a free, flexible, modern solution that doesn’t require paying for expensive software or relying on long-term vendor contracts.

Just as importantly, it protects them from vendor lock-in. If they start with a managed version of Screenlite and that provider shuts down, they still have options — they can switch to another provider or host it themselves.

And for some companies, that flexibility becomes even more valuable over time. A small business might start with a managed version of Screenlite for just a few screens. But as they grow, so do their costs — and they may eventually decide to self-host to save money or gain more control. Open source makes that transition possible, without needing to start over with a new system.

That kind of freedom helps grow the ecosystem. It also brings valuable real-world feedback that makes the product better for everyone — including my own future managed service.

## Final thoughts

Right now, my primary focus is on building the product itself.

A managed Screenlite service will come later — offering an easier, more reliable option for many users.

After all, self-hosting isn’t free just because the source code is open. Someone still needs to maintain, update, and secure the software, which can be a lot of work.

For businesses with only a few screens, using a managed service often makes more sense and is more cost-effective than managing everything themselves.

I’m completely okay with others launching their own managed versions of Screenlite.

However, I hope that some customers will choose the managed service run by the core team. This will help cover development costs and support further investment in marketing, support, and product improvements.

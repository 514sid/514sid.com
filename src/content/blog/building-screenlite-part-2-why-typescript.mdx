Today, most digital signage runs on web technology. Whether it is interactive kiosks greeting visitors or digital menu boards updating in real time, the web forms the foundation of modern signage systems. Platforms like webOS and Tizen are built around web apps. Because of this, browsers and web runtimes are the natural way to deliver content.

Think about the small but important features you see on these screens. News tickers scrolling headlines, live currency rates, or weather widgets all rely on web technologies. Even programmatic advertising, with its personalized messages, depends on the flexibility of the web. Browsers handle complex layouts easily. Thanks to standardization, these apps run well on many different devices.

Another big plus is cost. Building web apps is cheaper and easier for many developers. If you want a digital signage widget that pulls dynamic data from an API, you can build it once and run it on many different CMS platforms and players. This avoids being stuck with a single vendor.

Almost every digital signage software vendor today supports displaying web widgets, apps, or pages within their players. This flexibility allows developers to create interactive and dynamic content that runs across many different platforms and devices.

One popular example is BrightSign. BrightSign devices have strong support for web apps and even include a Node.js runtime. This allows developers to run custom server-side logic directly on the player.

Another example is signageOS. It runs web-based players on many operating systems and offers developers one unified API that hides each device's quirks. Their motto, "develop once, run everywhere", shows how JavaScript and web apps have become the standard for digital signage.

Native apps have their place, especially on less powerful devices like Raspberry Pis, where native code can offer better performance and stability. But with stronger hardware such as mini-PCs, commercial displays, or advanced Android players, web browsers and webviews usually work well. Plus, using web technology makes updates easier, improves compatibility, and simplifies maintenance.

For Screenlite, I chose TypeScript for the entire stack: player, backend, and frontend. Native code still matters, especially for Android devices. However, most of the app's logic will live in TypeScript.

Using one language across the project reduces the mental load of switching between languages. It keeps the codebase consistent and easier to maintain. This consistency is key for an open-source project. Clear, clean code helps more people contribute and makes the project stronger.

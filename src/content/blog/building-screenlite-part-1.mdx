title: Building Screenlite. Part 1

I've been working in digital signage since 2020 and have seen steady growth over the years.

Some studies estimate that there are about 90 million screens worldwide used for digital signage. That's a huge number and shows just how big this market is.

It's a really interesting field, with more than 500 players in the market of software products alone.

At the end of summer 2024, the idea for Screenlite came to me. I noticed that all open-source digital signage tools were either too complicated, outdated, or only partially open-source and poorly maintained. There wasn't an easy-to-use, modern, fully open-source option that people could rely on and build upon.

In December 2024, I bought the domain screenlite.org and started coding. Then, in May 2025, I published the source code on GitHub and began developing Screenlite publicly.

You can check out the progress here: https://github.com/screenlite/screenlite.

After sharing information about Screenlite on Reddit, I received a lot of responses in both comments and direct messages that showed there's a real need for an open-source tool like this. The Discord community is growing slowly, with new members joining over time.

Right now, the core features are mostly done, and I'm working on building out the frontend.

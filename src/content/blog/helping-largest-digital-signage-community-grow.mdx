title: Helping the largest digital signage community grow

I've been an active member of [r/digitalsignage](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalsignage) for a few months now, and recently I got invited to join the mod team. Honestly, I'm pretty excited about it because this subreddit is already the largest digital signage community online, and I think it can grow even more.

The digital signage market is actively growing and evolving. Despite that growth, there's still surprisingly little easy-to-find info for people who are new or just trying to figure things out. That's why I want to help build this community into a go-to place, not just a spot for vendors to drop ads, but a real hub for knowledge-sharing and honest discussion.

## Why Reddit? Why not Discord or something else?

There are many platforms out there — all with their own strengths. However, I truly believe Reddit is the best fit for building a digital signage community. Here's why.
### Everything’s indexed and searchable

One major advantage Reddit has over platforms like Discord or Slack is that its content is publicly indexed and easy to search. When someone Googles a question about digital signage, Reddit threads often show up in the search results, providing accessible, helpful discussions to a wide audience.

This visibility helps newcomers and experts alike find answers without needing to be part of a private group or server. Additionally, as AI chatbots increasingly rely on indexed web content, Reddit becomes an even more valuable resource that can reach people beyond the subreddit itself.

### Discussions are threaded and organized

Reddit’s format allows conversations to be threaded and well-organized. Replies are nested, which makes it easy to follow the flow of discussions, track specific answers, and see updates without wading through unrelated messages.

This structure helps keep conversations coherent and focused, unlike some chat-based platforms where important insights can quickly get buried under a flood of messages. For a community centered on sharing detailed knowledge and solving problems, this organization is essential.

## What I want to do as a mod

My goal is to keep growing the community in a way that's helpful for everyone. Whether you're brand new to digital signage or an industry vet, I want this to be a place where you can ask questions, share your experiences, and get real advice.

I've got enough time to moderate actively, answer questions where I can, and help keep discussions respectful and on-topic.

## Looking ahead

The digital signage world is only going to get bigger, and I want this subreddit to grow right alongside it. If we can build a community that's open, useful, and welcoming, it'll be a valuable resource for a lot of people.
